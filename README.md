# AI Interface Prototype

## Overview

This project is a modern, component-based AI interface prototype built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It provides a flexible and customizable UI for interacting with various AI models, managing prompts, and visualizing AI responses.

## Features

- **Theme Switching**: Toggle between light and dark modes with system preference detection
- **Model Selection**: Choose from various AI models with different capabilities
- **Prompt Management**: Create, save, and load prompt templates
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Fine-tune model parameters like temperature and max tokens
- **Chat Interface**: View AI responses in a chat-like interface with copy and download functionality
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components built with Tailwind CSS
- **Storybook Integration**: Visual component documentation and testing

## Research

### User Needs Analysis

The design of this AI interface prototype is based on research into the needs of different user groups:

1. **AI Beginners**: Need intuitive interfaces with clear explanations of parameters and capabilities
2. **Technical Users**: Require fine-grained control over model parameters and prompt engineering
3. **Content Creators**: Focus on template management and output formatting options
4. **Developers**: Need API-like access and integration capabilities

### Competitive Analysis

We analyzed several existing AI interfaces to identify best practices and opportunities for improvement:

| Interface | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| ChatGPT Web | Clean design, conversation history | Limited parameter control |
| Playground UI | Detailed parameter controls | Complex for beginners |
| Claude Interface | Simple, focused on conversation | Limited customization |
| Bard/Gemini | Quick responses, integrated tools | Less technical control |

### Key Insights

- Users prefer interfaces that adapt to their expertise level
- Parameter explanations improve user confidence and result quality
- Template management is essential for consistent results
- Visual feedback during generation improves perceived performance
- Dark mode is strongly preferred for reducing eye strain during extended use

## Design Decisions

### Component Architecture

The interface uses a component-based architecture to maximize reusability and maintainability:

- **Core UI Components**: Basic building blocks like buttons, sliders, and modals
- **Feature Components**: Higher-level components that combine UI components for specific features
- **Context Providers**: Manage global state like theme and selected model

### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme**: Neutral base with accent colors to highlight actions and important information
- **Typography**: Clean, readable font with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing system based on 4px increments
- **Dark Mode**: True black background for OLED screens with reduced contrast to minimize eye strain

### Accessibility Considerations

- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and saved preferences
- **History Management**: Save and retrieve past conversations
- **Advanced Prompting**: Support for few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting
- **File Upload**: Allow users to upload documents for context
- **Visualization Tools**: Add charts and graphs for parameter impact analysis
- **Collaborative Features**: Share prompts and results with team members
